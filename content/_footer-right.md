## You want to get to know us a bit better?

Even though an informed opinion on Effective Altruism based on internet resources and books is a good starting point we believe it is equally important to get to know the people and the community. Therefore we offer a broad range of frameworks you can use to get in touch with us.

You want to join us but also to stay in the background for the time being? Then our Meet-Ups would be a perfect fit for you. We discuss Effective Altruism and related topics in a bigger crowd where you can always find someone to discuss your questions or just meet new interesting people. 
And sometimes we go for a walk in Potsdams spacious parks!
For concrete questions you occupy yourself with we give you the opportunity to meet one of the local organizers for a coffee or another drink to discuss those specific questions exclusievly with you. This way you can get answers to all the questions you might think of as too trivial/inappropriate/critical to discuss them in a bigger group. 


If you want to become an active member of our local group we have a variety of task you can join in on. EA Potsdam stands for community building in a local, nationwide and global scope, exchange of expertise and spread of EA related knowledge. 
To accomplish the associated tasks you will learn to use new tools, socialize with the local organizers and get a look behind the curtains of EA Potsdam and its structure. 
In any case you can benefit from it!
